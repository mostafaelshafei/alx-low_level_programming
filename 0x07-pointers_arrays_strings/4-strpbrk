Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

Prototype: char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strpbrk. Run man strpbrk to learn more.
