Write a function that copies memory area.

Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
Returns a pointer to dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memcpy. Run man memcpy to learn more.
