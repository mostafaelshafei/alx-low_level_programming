Write a function that locates a substring.

Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strstr. Run man strstr to learn more
