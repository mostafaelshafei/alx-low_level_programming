Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strspn. Run man strspn to learn more.
