Write a function that locates a character in a string.

Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strchr. Run man strchr to learn more.
